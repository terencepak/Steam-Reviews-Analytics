# Steam_Reviews
 
Steam Players are a strong representation of the gaming market. There are over 1 billion Steam accounts and 90 million active users, which shows how large the videogame industry has become. Many of these players leave reviews of games that they have previously played. These can range from short comments to long narratives deconstrucing every aspect of the their experience with each game. There are millions of steam reviews out there that can help us identify what steam players are interested in playing and determine what types of games Steam players are interested in playing.
