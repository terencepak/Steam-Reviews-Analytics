Steam Players are a strong representation of the gaming market. There are over 1 billion Steam accounts and 90 million active users, which shows how large the videogame industry has become. Many of these players leave reviews of games that they have previously played. These can range from short comments to long narratives deconstrucing every aspect of the their experience with each game.

    Every person who has left a review has purchased the game
    Every person who has left a review meets minimum graphics requirements
    Not every person who has left a review has played the game fully

Primary Question(s):
    What are the most popular games and Why?
    What are the key attributes of popular games? Should Steam be interested in seeing these attributes?
    
Secondary Questions:
    What are key words differentiate a popular game vs an unpopular game?

    *(OriginalCost vs DiscountedPrice)
    *(Indie?)

Analysis:
    DataCleanup
        - Determine what games can be tied together with each dataset.
        - We will provide a summary statistics for the numerical variables (Mean, median, mode, quartiles)
        - Data Transformation of Genres, Platform, Ratings Breakdown (Metacritic), Players
        - Strategy for completed datesets.
            1) Merge 2 datasets together using the name and title fields
            2) Remove Outliers
            3) Determine the proprtion of steam reviewers that recommend the game
    What are key words differentiate a popular game vs an unpopular game?
        - Determine what are popular games. Clustered bar graph by the toal number of reviews
        - Using the sentiment analysis, top key words will be extracted using Bag-of-Words model?
        - Word Cloud from the steam reviews within each popular game
        - What do negative reviews mention?
    Are there certain genres that get more engagement and why? 
        - The Genre and Tags field contains all the genres that desribes the game in 1 field. We will have to break this up into multiple
        fields
        - Clustered bar graph to show games with the highest number of reviews within each genres and tags
        - (Ask Sharath on how to work this out?)
    Does the reviewed game prices have an effect on the reviewer's opinion of the game? 
        - Clustered bar graph to show games with the highest number of reviews within game price range (Free-to-Play - $60+)

        - (Maybe make a multiple variable regression)
    How much does Hardware (Graphics, Storage, Memory, Platform?) affect the user's review?  
        - Classification Algorithim (Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, Decision Tree)
        - (Ask Sharath on this approach?)
    How much does Game Design (Genres, Platform, Players) affect the user's review?
